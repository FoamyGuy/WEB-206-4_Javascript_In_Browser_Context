given a list of objects representing files such as:

const filesData = [
    {"owner": "timc", "filename": "helloworld.js"},
    {"owner": "timc", "filename": "towersofhanoi.js"},
]

Loop over the files in the list and add each one to a <ul> on the page.

For each file show it's owner and filename as well as a delete icon

When the delete icon is clicked show a dialog prompt that askes the user to confirm they want to delete the given file, include the owner of the file in the prompt as well.

Use data-attributes on the delete icon to store the filename and owner and access them from there inside of the click listener function for the delete icon.

If the user clicks yes to the prompt console log out a message indicating we are deleting the file, and remove it from the <ul> and hide the confirmation.

If the user clicks no to the prompt hide the confirmation without doing anything else.
