This file contains a list of extra practice exercises that are not included in the book.

We may work on some of these during class if time permits but likely will not complete all of them.

You are free to complete these exercises outside of class and then bring them to me to look over or offer help if you get stuck.

You are encouraged to go beyond the minimum items mentioned in the exercise use your creativity and include elemements and styling rules that are on the edges of your current knowledge. The more practice you can get the better!

- Write out the code for a basic web "seed" project that includes the minimally needed HTML, an External Stylesheet, and a script.js file. For future exercises you can start from the provided web seed, but it's good to have the experience of writing these things out at least once to get more familiar with them.
