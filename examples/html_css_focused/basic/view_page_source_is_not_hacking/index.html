  <p>Web developers and the companies or Govt. entities they work for are responsible for ensuring that no secure or private data is exposed via the systems they engineer and develop.</p>
  <p><strong>Tim's Golden Rule:</strong> Assume the user will be able to see anything that is included in the HTML/CSS/JS that you send to their browser, even if you have made an attempt to visually hide it. Do not include any private or secure data beyond what is strictly necessary for rendering the page that you want to show the user. Never include any users private information on a page being shown to anyone except for that specific user.
