# Javascript in the Browser Context

Javascript got its humble beginnings on the web. It was a tool created to allow more interactive and dynamic programs to exist on the web. HTML and CSS by themselves can only create static web pages that don't change or interact with the user in complex ways. 

Javascript allows us to make web applications instead of just static web pages. It lets us define behaviors for the page to do, and react to various types of input from the users. Traditionally JS was used only for front end web development. The code was executed by the browser on the users computer when they load the web page. 


In modern times Javascript come to have much wider usages. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) allows javascript to be used as a high level shell scripting language and to develop the backend server side portion of web applications. The [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) project has a port of javascript that runs on tiny microcontoller devices 84Mhz CPU with 96kb of RAM.

This course will focus more on the traditional usages JS. We'll be learning how to use JavaScript to make interactive and dynamic web applications. We'll also learn about some of the newer features and functionalities present in the latest released versions of JavaScript. If we have time we may take an introductory look at Node.js so we can see the contrast between it and the browser context.
